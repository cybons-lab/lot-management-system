## Overview
This PR consolidates the Holiday Calendar features with critical fixes for Forecast List performance and Async data generation.

## Key Changes

### 1. Forecast List Performance Fix (Critial)
- **Problem**: Forecast List page would 500/timeout with large datasets due to N+1 queries and in-memory pagination of thousands of groups.
- **Fix**:
    - Implemented DB-level pagination for Forecast Groups (`DISTINCT(customer, delivery_place, product)`).
    - Resolved N+1 query in `OrderLine.allocated_quantity` by adding `lot_reservations` relationship and eager loading.
    - Verified reduction from O(N) to O(1) query complexity per page.

### 2. Async Test Data Generation
- **Problem**: Generating large test data sets would timeout the HTTP request.
- **Fix**:
    - Implemented `JobManager` for background task execution.
    - Added progress tracking (0-100%) and polling API (`/api/admin/progress/{job_id}`).
    - Updated UI with a progress bar.

### 3. Holiday Calendar & Business Days
- Merged functionality from `codex/add-holiday-and-business-day-calendar`.
- Adds `HolidayCalendar`, `CompanyCalendar`, `OriginalDeliveryCalendar` models and APIs.
- Adds `CalendarService` for business day calculations.
- Adds `CalendarSettingsPage` for management.

### 4. Technical
- Refactored `GlobalNavigation.tsx` to improve readability.
- Resolved various lint errors in frontend and backend.
- Updated `docs/tasks/backlog.md` with user feedback tasks.
